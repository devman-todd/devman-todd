<h2> ⚡ Fun fact:</h2>

Before diving into cybersecurity, I spent years training clients in different gyms, all while using technology to run my fitness business efficiently. So at one point, I switched my major from nutrition to cybersecurity, and I haven't looked back since! From sweating it out with sets to securing IT assets, I'm all about flexing both my physical and digital muscles. (Thanks ChatGPT for the corny line 😅)
